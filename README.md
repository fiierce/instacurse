Notes on installation: 
Before installing greenlet/gevent, make sure libevent is installed, using brew:

brew install libevent

brew may put the installation on a funky place, if so run the following:

ln -s  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/8.5/Headers/X11 /usr/local/include/X11

Also, before installing PIL you will need libjpeg, using brew: 

brew install libjpeg
